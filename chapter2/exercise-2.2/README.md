Write a program that reads in the length of sides of an equilateral triangle and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\color{red}{area%20=%20\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left(length\%20\%20of\%20\%20sides\right)^{\small2}%20}" />  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large\color{red}{volume%20=%20area%20\times%20length}" />  
  
Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter length of the sides and height of the Equilateral triangle: 3   5  
The area is 3.89  
The volume of the Triangular prism is 19.48
</pre>
