Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate and then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters **10** for subtotal and **12%** for gratuity rate, the program displays **$1.2** as gratuity and **$11.2** as total. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter the subtotal and a gratuity rate: 10    12
The gratuity is $1.2 and total is $11.2
</pre>
