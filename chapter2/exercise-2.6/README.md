Write a program that reads an integer between **0** and **1000** and multiplies all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is **932**, the multiplication of all its digits is **54**.  
  
*Hint*: Use the **%** operator to extract digits, and use the **/** operator to remove the extracted digit. For instance, **932 % 10 = 2** and **932 / 10 = 93**.  
  
Here is a sample run:  
    
<pre>
Enter a number between 0 and 1000: 999
The multiplication of all digits in 999 is 729
