Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to make the change, as given by the following formula:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity *v*<sub>0</sub> in meters/second, the ending velocity *v*<sub>1</sub> in meters/second, and the time span *t* in seconds, then displays the average acceleration. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter v0, v1, and t: 5.5   50.9   4.5
The average acceleration is 10.0889
