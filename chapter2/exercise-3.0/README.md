Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an intitial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the intitial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large%20\color{red}{Q%20=%20M%20\times%20(finalTemperature%20-%20intitialTemperature)%20\times%204184}" />  
  
where **M** is the weight of the water in kilograms, intitial and final temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy **Q** is measured in joules. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
Enter the final temperature: 10.5
The energy needed is 1625484.0
