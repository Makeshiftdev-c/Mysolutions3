Suppose you save **$100** *each* month in a savings account with annual interest rate **3.75%**. Thus, the monthly interest rate is **0.0375 / 12 = 0.003125**. After the first month, the value in the account becomes  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large%20\color{red}{100%20\times%20\left(1%20%2B%200.003125\right)%20=%20100.3125}" />  
  
After the second month, the value in the account becomes  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large%20\color{red}{\left(100%20%2B%20100.3125\right)%20\times%20\left(1%20%2B%200.003125\right)%20=%20200.938}" />  
  
After the third month, the value in the account becomes  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large%20\color{red}{\left(100%20%2B%20200.938\right)%20\times%20\left(1%20%2B%200.003125\right)%20=%20301.878}" />  
  
and so on.  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month. (In Exercise 5.30, you will use a loop to simplify the code and display the account value for any month.)  
  
<pre>
Enter the monthly saving amount: 100
After the first month, the account value is 100.3125
After the second month, the account value is 200.9384765625
After the third month, the account value is 301.8789093017578
After the sixth month, the account value is 606.5967866995037
