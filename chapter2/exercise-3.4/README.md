Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. Note one pound is **0.45359237** kilograms and one inch is **0.0254** meters. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
