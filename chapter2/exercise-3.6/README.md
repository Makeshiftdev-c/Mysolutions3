Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. The formula for computing the area of a hexagon is  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge%20\color{red}{Area%20=%20\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}%20s^{2}%20}" />,  
  
where *s* is the length of a side. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter the length of the side: 5.5
The area of the hexagon is 78.5918
