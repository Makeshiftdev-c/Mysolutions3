If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge%20\color{red}{interest%20=%20balance%20\times%20\frac{annualInterestRate}{1200}}" />  
  
Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and displays the interest for the next month. Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter balance and interest rate (e.g., 3 for 3%): 1000   3.5
The interest is 2.91667
</pre>
