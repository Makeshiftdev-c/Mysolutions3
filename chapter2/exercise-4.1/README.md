Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years and displays the future investment value using the following formula:  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\huge%20\color{red}{futureInvestmentValue%20=%20investmentAmount%20\times%20\left(1%20%2B%20monthlyInterestRate\right)^{numberOfYears%20\times%2012}}" />  
  
For example, if you enter amount **1000**, annual interest rate **3.25%**, and number of years **1**, the future investment value is **1032.98**.  
  
Here is a sample run:  
  
<pre>
Enter investment amount: 1000.56
Enter annual interest rate in percentage: 4.25
Enter number of years: 1
Future value is $1043.92
</pre>
