A linear equation can be solved using Cramer's rule given in Programming Exercise 1.13. Write a program that prompts the user to enter *a*, *b*, *c*, *d*, *e*, and *f* and displays the result. If *ad* - *bc* is **0**, report that "The equation has no solution."  
  
<pre>
Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 9.0   4.0   3.0   -5.0   -6.0   -21.0
x is -2.0 and y is 3.0
