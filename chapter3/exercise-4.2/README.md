Write a program that prompts the user to enter a three-digit integer and determines whether it is a palindrome *integer*. An *integer* is a palindrome if it reads the same from right to left and from left to right. A negative integer is treated the same as a positive integer. Here are sample runs of this program:  
  
<pre>
Enter a three-digit integer: 121
121 is a palindrome
</pre>  
  
<pre>
Enter a three-digit integer: 123
123 is a palindrome
</pre>
