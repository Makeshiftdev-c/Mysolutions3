A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in pounds).  
  
<img alt="formula" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large%20\color{red}{c_{\left(w\right)}%20=%20\begin{cases}2.5%260%20<%20w%20\leq%202%20\\\\4.5%262%20<%20w%20\leq%204\\\\7.5%264%20<%20w%20\leq%2010\\\\10.5%2610%20<%20w%20\leq%2020\end{cases}}" />  
  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost. If the weight is greater than 20, display a message "the package cannot be shipped."
